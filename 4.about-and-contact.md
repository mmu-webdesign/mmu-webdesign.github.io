## Guest lecturing for us <a name="guest"></a>

We are always interested in getting speakers to talk to our students about the latest industry practices. In some cases you don't need to prepare anything: we'll just get you to wander around the classroom, talking to students and seeing how they are getting on with their projects.

If you are interested in lecturing, please contact [Richard Eskins](mailto:r.eskins@mmu.ac.uk).
