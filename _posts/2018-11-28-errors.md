# An interesting list of coding errors

## HTML

* Never put HTML content (e.g. paragraphs, headings, lists) in the head. Only links to stylesheets or metadata belong there.
* It's best to copy and paste doctypes or metadata tags as the content in them can be complex to type in, and it's important there are no errors. 
* There should be no content or tags between the closing `</head>` and the opening `<body>` tags - things should be in one or the other.
* Check you haven't added any stray characters to your code.

### Attributes

* Attributes are `name="value"`, not `name+"value"` or `name "value"` or `name:"value"` or `name-"value"`. Check you are using the right attribute name - `href` is different to `ref` or `rel`. It's very unusual to need to have an attribute with no value in it, e.g. href="" - there should always be something inside the quotes. 
* For languages (e.g. `<html lang="en">`) you need to use the official abbreviation, not one you create. 
* You can't misspell attribute names or values - computers aren't smart enough to know what you mean.

### Working with tags

* Close your tags - always check there is a starting tag `<tag>` and an ending tag `</tag>`. Any and all of these:
    * `<tag/>`
    * `<t/ag>`
    * `</tag/>`
    * `</tag`
    * `</tag>>` **won't work**. 
    * Using an ending tag `</ul>` as the start tag won't work. 
* If you have a self-closing tag like `<img>` you don't necessarily need the ending `<img />` slash - for tags that contain content you always need the ending tag, e.g. `<p></p>`. So whenever you start a tag, check you've finished it. That includes the `'<'` and the `'>'`.
* Make sure your tags are opened and closed in the correct sequence: `<strong><span>text</span></strong>` would be OK, but `<strong><span>test</strong></span>` is not.
* Don't repeat tags, just make sure that each one you open you eventually close. Don't mix block level elements with in-line elements - e.g. `<p><div></div></p>` won't work, neither will `<strong><div></div></strong>`
* This is especially true for `<a>` tags - you need `<a href="[web address]">[link text]</a>`. **Always close your tags**.

### Specific tags

* Watch the 'nesting' of a `<ul>` inside a `<dl>` tag:

```
<dl>
    <dt>Term</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Some text</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Item</li>
        <li>Item</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>
```

and make sure you have `<dt>`s and `<dd>`s inside your `<dl>`. Make sure you have a `<dl>` before you start doing `<dt>`s and `<dd>`s. 
* It's very unusual to have a `<dl>` inside a `<ul>`.
* If you start a `<ul>` all the content should be inside `<li>`s until you close the `</ul>`
* Make sure you write the sequence of table rows and columns correctly - always

```
<tr><td>Item</td><td>Item</td></tr>
``` 

* Start with the row, then the column or header tag.

## CSS

* Never put HTML in a CSS file (or vice versa) or save a HTML document as `.css`.
* The pattern is:
```
selector { property: value; }
p { color: red;}
```
So missing out the `:` or the `;` will cause problems. Forgetting both or one of the curly brackets will cause problems. 
* You always need a selector before the curly brackets. 
* Always close one css declaration before you open another one.
* You will need to spell some of the selectors in the american way - `color` rather than `colour`. CSS isn't set up to understand both.
* Properties and values should always be in lower case.
```p {Font-Size: 1em; Color:red}```
should be
```p {font-size: 1em; color: red;}```
* It's not wrong to end your last line inside the curly brackets without a `;` but it will probably cause you issues at some point - it's a good habit to get into:
    * `p {font-size: 1em; color:red}` is OK but
    * `p {font-size: 1em; color: red;}` is better if you need to add another rule
* Don't start your stylesheet with a tab: start from the left margin.
