# How to be an effective student

## Learning how to learn

Are you overwhelmed by the amount of stuff as web people that we are all supposed to not just know but master?

It's easy to feel like everything is spinning out of control, and that your skills are slipping. 

Who benefits from this feeling? Not you. Not your work colleagues.

Part of the problem is that we are not encouraged to step back and plan what we want to learn: there is no structure, apart from whichever blog post gets us excited about the latest new technology. Learning happens best when it is planned and cumulative towards a planned goal.

Why is this? One influential idea for educators is the 'zone of proximal development': the idea that we have to reach a certain level in background skills before we can really understand new concepts. This is why it's not a good idea to learn React without having a good background in javascript already. You might be able to follow a tutorial and get something up and running, but as soon as you stray from the path someone else has planned - what happens then? 

## How to plan your learning

We all know that the latest, cutting edge explanations and examinations of web technologies takes place on-line. Twitter observations turn into blog posts, turn into influential articles, and then become accepted good practice.

But do we need to start at this point? Would it sometimes be better to really grasp the fundamental concepts, to slow down and be sure that you are able to build on a strong foundation?

Even if books date quickly they have one important advantage: they've been checked by experts, and edited so that they introduce the concepts you need to know in (hopefully) a logical order. How often do you just read the bit that helps you with one small aspect of the code? (the page on PHP dates in my PHP book is the only one I ever look at)

This is one way to use books, but actually reading them from beginning to end is another. By all means, skip the bits you know, but look at the way the author introduces ideas and how everything is structured.

## Learning by doing

A new discipline can seem overwhelming because there is so muuch to learn. It's impossible to learn it all at once. So I suggest planning a project, but breaking it down into smaller pieces. Even doing this will help you recognise where your skills are lacking - how do I create this layout? I know where I need to get to but how? Identifying these problems and writing  them down will make them seem more attainable. And each milestone you reach will encourage you for the next one. Learning by completing a project, rather than attempting to understand every part of a language will give you much greater insight.

## Asking for help

Sometimes the best thing to do when you have a code problem is to step away from the computer. Don't try another way of doing it, don't search for another  syntax error - just stop. Give yourself time away from the screen. You'd be surprised how often you spot the error when you come back to it, or the solution comes to you at weird times. Another good idea is to try explaning the problem to yourself - go through every step, one at a time. Explain it to yourself (or someone else if you can find someone who'll listen) and you'll often find that the flaw in your logic will be obvious.

## Copying as practising (NOT plagiarism)

We all know that the  original, unique solution is the one everyone remembers. But to get to that point you need to understand your discipline and your medium. So don't start wanting to create something new, start by wanting to create what has come before - copy. Copying gives you a way of measuring your ability with tools (software, pens, pencils, whatever tool it is) - can you reproduce what's been done? The amount of brain processing power you need to devote to figuring out what the tool will do generally relates to the quality of what you will produce - mastering the tools means you can think more about the solution, less about how to actually bring it into being.

## Knowing when it's working

If you can predict what the code is going to do before you run it, or view it, and  it does that - congraluations, you're starting to achieve mastery. You'll also know what you need to learn when things don't work as expected first time (I'm looking at you, flexbox). Beginners get frustrated when things don't work as expected, but people who have learned effectively understand when their mental model of how things work in the real world deviates from how the code is implemented.
