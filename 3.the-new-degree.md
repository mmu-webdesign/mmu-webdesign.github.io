# Things are changing
## Update 21 January 2020

*Please note. this is a personal perspective, not official MMU. There may be changes and decisions that I am not party to, that will influence the final outcome.*

Many of you know our BSc Web Development programme has not recruited for the last two years and will close this summer as our final cohort graduate. This programme is conjunction with three others has successfully produced graduates who have gone into front-end, back-end, software development, UXD, UX research, project management, product managers, media producers, designers, dev ops, testers, marketers, SEO and a bunch more roles in digital. It all started with our dabbling with HTML in 1994 and the first coding unit around 1996.

For the last two years we have recruited solely to the BSc Digital media and Communications. We think these students will graduate into a number of the above roles, but while understanding front-end, most will not be coders.

## So what happens now?

Currently there is a lot of good news. 

We are being given the chance to develop a revised programme, Web and UX Design, for the new [School of Digital Arts (SoDA)](https://www.schoolofdigitalarts.mmu.ac.uk/) for 2021. Currently this programme is one of a suite of programmes lined up to form part of the School.  We hope to continue our previous schedule for front-end development but to include more design, design theory and UX practices.

We believe that being part of the multidisciplinary School of Digital Arts will offer an industry like environment as they work across disciplines and practices.

As a team we were also involved with the development of Digital User Experience (UX) Professional Integrated Degree Apprenticeship Standard. This has led to the cross-faculty development and launch of a UX Apprentice Degree (as part of SoDA) for September 2020.
