# Our degree is changingâ€¦

Some may know our Web Dev programme has not recruited this year as it will close in 2020. 

Well the good news is that we are being given the chance to develop a revised programme, Web Design and UX, for the new [School of Digital Arts (SoDA)](https://www.schoolofdigitalarts.mmu.ac.uk/) for 2021.

As part of our initial pitch we are looking for supporting statements from our friends in industry including employers and graduates. Of course we will be coming back to you to seek your input into the content and format over the coming months.

Please contact [Richard Eskins](mailto:r.eskins@mmu.ac.uk) if you would like to help.
